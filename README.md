# MorrisLecar
phase portraits and bifurcation diagram of Morris Lecar Model

file andamento_orbite_01.m = phase portrait, equilibria and some orbits of ML model with applied current = 0.1

file andamento_orbite_006.m = phase portrait equilibria and some orbits of ML model with applied current = 0.06

file bifurcation.m = bifurcation diagramm using diagram.dat data (get through XXPAUT)

file rk5.m = Runge-Kutta order 5 to choose time step

file ML.m = to sum up all bifurcations and phase portraits with user's interaction --> change the value of I_{app} and both the plots will change.
